# Introduction
SpamGuard is a blockchain-based application that aims to efficiently detect and verify spam calls, emails, and messages while ensuring the reliability of collected data and protecting user privacy. The project addresses the growing concern of spam messages and calls, which can be a nuisance and sometimes lead to fraud and identity theft.

# Objective
The main objective of SpamGuard is to create a decentralized and secure system for spam detection and verification. By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology, we ensure the validity and authenticity of the crowd-sourced data, making the system more reliable and tamper-proof.

# Features
  * User-friendly interface for reporting and verifying spam
  * Blockchain as a database for secure and immutable data storage
  * Crypto reward system to incentivize user participation and data accuracy
  * Machine Learning (ML) model for spam classification and risk scoring
  * User Feedback-based Refinement for constant system improvement

# How It Works:
  * Reporting Spam: Users can report spam calls, emails, or messages through the user-friendly interface. They provide details such as the type of spam and description.

  * Blockchain Storage: Reported spam data is securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring its reliability and protection from tampering.

  * Crypto Reward System: Users are incentivized to report spam by receiving cryptocurrency rewards once their data is validated.

  * ML Classification: The system employs an ML model to classify reported spam based on their descriptions. The model generates a risk score for each entry.

  * User Feedback-based Refinement: Users can rate the accuracy of the spam classification and risk score, which helps refine the ML algorithm.
